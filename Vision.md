### Vision statement
To Create awareness about the risk of being exploited by blindly accepting Terms and Conditions(T&Cs).
And hence bring about a change in something users have been taking for granted since the inception of technology.
To build a browser extension that:
1. Filters important clauses, given any T&C document, and displays only important clauses.
2. Summarizes and groups the clauses in meaningful contexts.
